**Performance Comparison of Predictive Models for Mechanical Component Maintenance**

This repository contains the source code for a project that evaluates the performance of four predictive models on a dataset related to maintenance of mechanical components. The models considered are:

    Random Forest
    Decision Tree
    Gradient Boosting
    Naive Bayes

**Dataset Description**

The dataset includes data on various mechanical components, capturing parameters such as temperature, rotational speed, torque, etc. The objective is to identify the model that performs best in predicting maintenance needs based on these parameters.
